    "Feature selection is an important factor in modeling anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. Since anomaly detection systems often need to handle large amounts of data, feature selection is usually applied to reduce data complexity and optimize classification accuracy and running time. An irrelevant feature can result in overfitting and affect the modeling power of classification algorithms ¹. In other words, feature selection helps to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the detection of anomalies while ignoring the irrelevant ones. This results in a more efficient and accurate detection system ¹. "
