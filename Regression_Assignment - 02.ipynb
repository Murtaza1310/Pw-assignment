    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used in linear regression models to assess the goodness of fit¹². It indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variable that the independent variables explain collectively¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concept**: R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 – 100% scale¹. It evaluates the scatter of the data points around the fitted regression line¹. For the same data set, higher R-squared values represent smaller differences between the observed data and the fitted values¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculation**: The formula for calculating R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$R^2 = \\frac{SS_{\\text{regression}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $SS_{\\text{regression}}$ is the sum of squares due to regression (explained sum of squares), and $SS_{\\text{total}}$ is the total sum of squares². The sum of squares due to regression measures how well the regression model represents the data used for modeling. The total sum of squares measures the variation in the observed data (data used in regression modeling)².\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation**: R-squared is always between 0 and 100%¹. A value of 0% represents a model that does not explain any of the variation in the response variable around its mean. The mean of the dependent variable predicts the dependent variable as well as the regression model¹. A value of 100% represents a model that explains all the variation in the response variable around its mean¹. Generally, a higher R-squared indicates more variability is explained by the model². However, it's important to note that a high R-squared is not always good, and a low R-squared is not always bad¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, while R-squared provides useful insights regarding the regression model, it does not disclose information about causation between independent and dependent variables, nor does it indicate correctness of the regression model². Therefore, it should be analyzed together with other variables in a statistical model²."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model¹². It increases only when the new variable improves the model more than would be expected by chance¹². It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance¹². Adjusted R-squared is always less than or equal to R-squared¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concept**: Adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of independent variables used for predicting the dependent variable¹². It provides a more accurate measure of how well future samples are likely to be predicted by the model¹². Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when comparing the goodness of fit of regression models that have a different number of predictors¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculation**: The formula for calculating Adjusted R-squared is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left( \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k - 1} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $n$ is the sample size and $k$ is the number of predictors¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difference from R-squared**: The key difference between R-squared and Adjusted R-squared is that while R-squared always increases or remains the same when new predictors are added to the model, Adjusted R-squared increases only if the new predictor enhances the model above what would be predicted by chance¹². It penalizes you for adding independent variables that do not improve your existing model³.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both R-squared and Adjusted R-squared can provide valuable insights about a regression model, they should be used in conjunction with other statistical measures to assess the validity and predictability of the model¹²."

   "source": [
    "The adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when you have multiple predictor variables in your regression model. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The R-squared value of a model will always increase when a new predictor variable is added, even if the new variable is almost completely unrelated to the response variable¹.\n",
    "- This can lead to a situation where a model with a large number of predictor variables has a high R-squared value, even if the model doesn't fit the data well¹.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 – \\left[ \\frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- $R^2$: The R-squared of the model\n",
    "- $n$: The number of observations\n",
    "- $k$: The number of predictor variables¹\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjusted R-squared tells us how well a set of predictor variables is able to explain the variation in the response variable, adjusted for the number of predictors in a model¹. Because of the way it’s calculated, adjusted R-squared can be used to compare the fit of regression models with different numbers of predictor variables¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, it's more appropriate to use adjusted R-squared when you want to account for the number of predictors in your model and avoid overfitting⁴. It provides a more robust metric, especially when evaluating models with various predictors³."

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{MAE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \\hat{y_i}|}{n}$$\n",

    "$$\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{MSE}}$$\n",

    "    - **Disadvantages**: Like MSE, RMSE also penalizes models with large errors⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, each metric has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The choice of which one to use depends on the specific use case and understanding of these metrics¹. For example, if you would like to give more weights to observations that are further from the mean (i.e., if being “off” by 20 is more than twice as bad as being off by 10), then it’s better to use the RMSE to measure error because the RMSE is more sensitive to observations that are further from the mean⁵."

It's a regularization technique used in statistical modeling and machine learning to estimate the relationships between variables and make predictions¹.

This feature makes Lasso particularly useful for feature selection, as it can automatically identify and discard irrelevant or redundant variables¹.\n",

    "Regularized linear models help prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function³. This penalty term discourages the model from assigning excessive importance to specific features, promoting a more balanced and generalized representation⁸. The regularization term shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero³, which helps control the model's complexity³.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two commonly used types of regularization: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge). Both of these techniques add a penalty for complexity to the loss function, but they do it in different ways¹².\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of how Ridge Regression, a type of regularized linear model, works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a linear regression model where the cost function is Mean Squared Error (MSE). In Ridge Regression, we add a penalty term to this cost function. The penalty is the sum of the squares of all feature weights, multiplied by some tuning parameter λ. This is also known as L2 regularization⁶.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Cost Function} = \\text{MSE} + λ * (\\text{sum of squares of weights})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding this penalty term, Ridge Regression tends to spread the coefficient values out more equally. For high-dimensional datasets where multicollinearity exists between the features, Ridge Regression can help create a more stable and interpretable model⁵.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling**: Regularized linear models are sensitive to the scale of input features³. If features are not standardized before training, features with larger scales can dominate the penalty term, leading to biased estimates³.\n",

Selecting an appropriate value requires careful tuning and cross-validation¹, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets¹.\n",

    "5. **Performance with Noisy Data**: Regularized linear models can underperform when the dataset is noisy (contains irrelevant information) or too small². The model might end up detecting patterns in the noise itself².\n",

For instance, if you have a large number of irrelevant features in your dataset, a tree-based model or a neural network might be a better choice as they can handle complex non-linear relationships and automatically select important features⁵.
