    "GridSearchCV, which stands for Grid Search Cross-Validation, is a technique used in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning¹⁴. The purpose of GridSearchCV is to determine the optimal values for a given model's hyperparameters¹³. The performance of a machine learning model significantly depends on the value of its hyperparameters¹³.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Hyperparameters**: We pass predefined values for hyperparameters to the GridSearchCV function by defining a dictionary. This dictionary contains the hyperparameters along with the values they can take¹. For example, if we're tuning an SVM model, our dictionary might look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    " 'C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000],\n",
    " 'gamma': [1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001],\n",
    " 'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear', 'sigmoid']\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, `C`, `gamma`, and `kernel` are some of the hyperparameters of an SVM model¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Cross-Validation**: GridSearchCV tries all the combinations of the values passed in the dictionary and evaluates the model for each combination using the Cross-Validation method¹³. This gives us accuracy/loss for every combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Select Optimal Values**: After using this function, we can choose the hyperparameters with the best performance¹³.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that GridSearchCV is part of Scikit-learn's `model_selection` package¹, so you need to have the Scikit-learn library installed on your computer to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can significantly improve a model's performance but it can also be computationally expensive as it involves training and evaluating a model for each combination of hyperparameters³."

    "\n",
    "- **GridSearchCV**: This method creates a grid over the search space and evaluates the model for all possible hyperparameters in the space¹. It is simple and exhaustive, meaning it considers all possible combinations of hyperparameters². However, it can be computationally expensive if the search space is large (e.g., many hyperparameters)¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RandomizedSearchCV**: This method uses a random set of hyperparameters¹. It is useful when there are many hyperparameters, so the search space is large¹. It only samples a few random combinations of hyperparameters², which makes it less computationally expensive than GridSearchCV².\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other depends on your specific situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You might prefer **GridSearchCV** when you have fewer hyperparameters and computational resources are not a concern. It ensures that you don't miss out on any potential combination¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, **RandomizedSearchCV** can be a better choice when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters or when computational resources are limited. It can provide a good solution in a shorter amount of time by randomly sampling the search space²."

    "Data leakage in machine learning refers to a mistake made by the creator of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between the test and training datasets¹²⁴. This additional information can allow the model to learn or know something that it otherwise would not know and in turn invalidate the estimated performance of the model being constructed²⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem because it can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates²⁶. The model may perform well on the test set because it has seen that data during training, but it may perform poorly on new, unseen data⁶⁸. This is because the model has effectively memorized the training set data and is easily able to correctly output the labels or values for those examples in the test dataset⁶.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of data leakage: Let's say you're trying to predict whether a patient will be admitted to the hospital based on their symptoms. If your training data includes a feature like 'number of days spent in the hospital', this could cause data leakage. This is because this feature would not be available at the time of prediction (since you're trying to predict hospital admission), but it's included in your training data. As a result, your model might perform well on your test data (since it also includes this feature), but it would perform poorly in real-world predictions where this feature isn't available²."

    "\n",
    "4. **Cross-Validation**: Use hold-back validation strategies like cross-validation to estimate the performance of the model³.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Normalization**: Normalize your data correctly before cross-validation to avoid duplicates³.\n",
