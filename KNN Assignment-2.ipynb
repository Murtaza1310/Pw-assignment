    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN is the way they measure distance. The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points in a Euclidean space, while the Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than the Manhattan distance, as it takes into account the squared differences between the coordinates of two points. The Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is less sensitive to outliers, as it only takes into account the absolute differences between the coordinates of two points. \n",
