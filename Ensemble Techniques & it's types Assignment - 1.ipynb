    "Boosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. A weak learner is a model that performs slightly better than random guessing, while a strong learner is a model that has high accuracy and generalization. Boosting works by iteratively adding weak learners to the ensemble and assigning them weights based on their performance. The final prediction is made by taking a weighted vote of all the weak learners in the ensemble. Boosting can improve the accuracy and reduce the bias of the individual models, but it may also increase the variance and the risk of overfitting. Some examples of boosting algorithms are AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost."
