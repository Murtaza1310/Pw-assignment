    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to the seasonal patterns in a time series that change over time. These patterns can be daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly, and they can be influenced by various factors such as weather, holidays, and other events. For example, the sales of ice cream may increase during the summer months and decrease during the winter months. However, this pattern may change over time due to factors such as climate change, changes in consumer behavior, or other external factors. To analyze time series data with time-dependent seasonal components, it may be necessary to transform the data to reduce the fluctuations in the seasonal and noise components ¹. "
