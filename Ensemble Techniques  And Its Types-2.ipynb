    "Bagging is a technique that reduces overfitting in decision trees by taking samples and constructing many trees. The final prediction is obtained by averaging or voting the predictions of the individual trees. This reduces the sensitivity to noise and missing values in high-dimensional data ¹. However, bagging also increases the bias, which is compensated by the reduction in variance ¹. "

The base learners used in bagging can be any algorithm that can be used for classification or regression. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using different types of base learners in bagging:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Trees**: Decision trees are simple to understand and interpret, and they can handle both categorical and numerical data. However, they are prone to overfitting and can be unstable when the data changes ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest**: Random forest is an extension of decision trees that uses a combination of bagging and random feature selection to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy. It can handle high-dimensional data and is less prone to overfitting than decision trees. However, it can be computationally expensive and may not work well with noisy data ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-Nearest Neighbors**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric algorithm that can be used for classification and regression. It is simple to implement and can handle both categorical and numerical data. However, it can be sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the number of neighbors ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Support Vector Machines**: Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful algorithm that can be used for classification and regression. It can handle high-dimensional data and is less prone to overfitting than decision trees. However, it can be computationally expensive and may not work well with noisy data ¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Neural Networks**: Neural Networks are powerful algorithms that can be used for classification and regression. They can handle complex data and can learn non-linear relationships between the input and output variables. However, they can be computationally expensive and require a large amount of data to train ¹."

    "\n",
    "In general, the bias of the ensemble decreases as the complexity of the base learner increases, while the variance of the ensemble increases as the complexity of the base learner increases ¹.
