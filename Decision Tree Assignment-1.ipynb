    "The **Decision Tree** algorithm is a supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and regression problems ¹. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules, and each leaf node represents the outcome ¹. The algorithm starts from the root node of the tree and compares the values of the root attribute with the record attribute of the dataset. Based on the comparison, it follows the branch and jumps to the next node ¹. This process continues until it reaches a leaf node, which represents the final output of the decision tree ¹. \n",

    "The decision tree algorithm is preferred for solving classification problems because it is easy to understand and provides a graphical representation of all possible solutions to a problem based on given conditions ¹. The logic behind the decision tree can be easily understood because it shows a tree-like structure ¹. The decision tree algorithm is also versatile and can handle both categorical and numerical data ¹.\n",

The CART algorithm is a recursive partitioning method that splits the dataset into smaller subsets based on the value of a single attribute ¹.

The process of removing unwanted branches from the tree is called pruning ¹."

The attribute with the highest information gain is selected as the splitting attribute ¹.\n",
