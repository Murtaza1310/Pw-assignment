    "**Overfitting** happens when a model becomes too complex and learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern¹. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data⁶. The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on test or validation data, reduced model interpretability, and increased computational complexity⁷. To mitigate overfitting, several techniques can be employed, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization**: By adding a regularization term to the loss function, we can penalize overly complex models and encourage simpler solutions¹.\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Splitting the data into multiple subsets and evaluating the model's performance on each subset can help identify overfitting¹.\n",
