    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two common techniques used to encode categorical data into numerical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding** is used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or ranking. In this case, retaining the order is important. Hence encoding should reflect the sequence. For example, consider a dataset with a column named \"Education\" that contains values such as \"High School\", \"Bachelor's Degree\", \"Master's Degree\", and \"PhD\". Here, we can use Ordinal Encoding to convert these values into numerical values such as 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively ²³.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding** is used when encoding target variables, especially for categorical variables with no inherent order. It is important to note that Label Encoding introduces an arbitrary order to the categorical values, which may lead to incorrect assumptions by the model. To avoid this issue, one can consider using one-hot encoding or other methods such as ordinal encoding, which provide more appropriate representations for categorical data ⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset with a column named \"Color\" that contains values such as \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\". Here, we can use Label Encoding to convert these values into numerical values such as 0, 1, and 2 respectively ¹.\n",

    "In summary, Ordinal Encoding is suitable when categorical variables have an inherent order or ranking while Label Encoding is appropriate when encoding target variables, especially for categorical variables with no inherent order."

    "**Target Guided Ordinal Encoding** is a technique used to encode categorical variables for machine learning models. This encoding technique is particularly useful when the target variable is ordinal, meaning that it has a natural order, such as low, medium, and high ².\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technique, we will transform our categorical variable by comparing it to the target or output variable. The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a categorical variable.\n",
    "2. Take the aggregated mean of the categorical variable and apply it to the target variable.\n",
    "3. Sort the categorical variable in ascending order based on the aggregated mean.\n",
    "4. Assign ordinal values to each category based on their sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset with a column named \"Education\" that contains values such as \"High School\", \"Bachelor's Degree\", \"Master's Degree\", and \"PhD\". Suppose we want to predict the salary of an employee based on their education level. Here, we can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to convert these values into numerical values such as 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively ².\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful in scenarios where we have a large number of categories in a categorical variable and where one-hot encoding may not be feasible due to memory constraints. It can also be used when we have ordinal target variables and want to encode our categorical variables in a way that reflects their relationship with the target variable ²."
