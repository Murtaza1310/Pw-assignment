    "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that attempts to build a strong classifier from the number of weak classifiers. It is done by building a model by using weak models in series. Firstly, a model is built from the training data. Then the second model is built which tries to correct the errors present in the first model. This procedure is continued and models are added until either the complete training data set is predicted correctly or the maximum number of models are added. Boosting can improve the accuracy of the model by combining several weak models’ accuracies and averaging them for regression or voting over them for classification to increase the accuracy of the final model. Boosting can reduce the risk of overfitting by reweighting the inputs that are classified wrongly. Boosting can handle the imbalance data by focusing more on the data points that are misclassified. Boosting can increase the interpretability of the model by breaking the model decision process into multiple processes. "
