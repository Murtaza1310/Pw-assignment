    "**Lasso Regression**, also known as **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)**, is a popular technique used in statistical modeling and machine learning to estimate the relationships between variables and make predictions¹⁶. It's a regularization technique that uses shrinkage, where data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean¹⁷. The primary goal of Lasso Regression is to find a balance between model simplicity and accuracy¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression starts with the standard linear regression model, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target). The linear regression equation can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₚxₚ + ε$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the dependent variable (target).\n",
    "- $β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ$ are the coefficients (parameters) to be estimated.\n",
    "- $x₁, x₂, ..., xₚ$ are the independent variables (features).\n",
    "- $ε$ represents the error term¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression introduces an additional penalty term based on the absolute values of the coefficients. The L1 regularization term is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter λ:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L₁ = λ * (|β₁| + |β₂| + ... + |βₚ|)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $λ$ is the regularization parameter that controls the amount of regularization applied.\n",
    "- $β₁, β₂, ..., βₚ$ are the coefficients¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of Lasso Regression is to find the values of the coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values, while also minimizing the L1 regularization term¹:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Minimize: RSS + L₁}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between Lasso Regression and other regression techniques like Ridge Regression or ordinary linear regression lies in how they handle feature selection and multicollinearity¹³⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "While Ridge Regression shrinks all coefficients by a small amount towards zero but doesn't zero them out, Lasso Regression can reduce some coefficients to exactly zero³⁴. This property makes Lasso Regression particularly useful for feature selection as it can automatically identify and discard irrelevant or redundant variables¹. \n",

    "In summary, Lasso Regression is well-suited for models showing high levels of multicollinearity or when you want to automate certain parts of model selection, like variable selection/parameter elimination¹."

    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to perform automatic feature selection and regularization¹³⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "By driving some regression coefficients to zero, Lasso Regression identifies and prioritizes the most relevant features¹. This promotes sparsity in the model and enables automatic feature selection, which is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the regularization parameter increases, the coefficients of some features can shrink to zero, effectively removing them from the model³. This reduces the model’s complexity and makes it more interpretable, thereby minimizing the risk of overfitting³.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used as an alternative to feature selection methods such as stepwise Regression but with additional benefits like regularization, which can help prevent overfitting⁴. Additionally, since it forces some coefficients to be exactly zero, it is useful for identifying unimportant features that can be dropped from the model⁴.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model are interpreted in a similar way to those in linear regression, but with some important differences¹²:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Size of Coefficients**: The size of the coefficients can give you an idea of the importance of different features. Larger coefficients mean that the feature has a bigger impact on the response variable¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shrinkage**: Lasso Regression introduces a penalty term that shrinks the coefficients towards zero¹. This shrinkage means that less important features will have their coefficients reduced faster¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias and Variance**: The coefficients are biased towards zero, which can lead to a decrease in variance and potentially a better model fit¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scaling**: The coefficients in Lasso Regression are sensitive to the scale of the variables. Therefore, it's often recommended to standardize the predictors before fitting a Lasso Regression model².\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multicollinearity**: In the presence of multicollinearity, Lasso Regression can distribute the effect of collinear variables across their coefficients, which can make them harder to interpret¹."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter, often denoted as λ¹³⁴⁶. This parameter controls the strength of the penalty term and thus the amount of shrinkage¹³⁴. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how λ affects the model's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **λ = 0**: All features are considered, and the model is equivalent to linear regression. Only the residual sum of squares is considered to build a predictive model⁶.\n",
    "2. **λ = ∞**: No feature is considered. As λ approaches infinity, it eliminates more and more features⁶.\n",
    "3. **Bias and Variance**: The bias increases with an increase in λ, while variance decreases with an increase in λ⁶.\n",
    "4. **Shrinkage**: λ denotes the amount of shrinkage. A larger λ implies heavier penalty and tends to produce a sparser model⁴.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an appropriate value for λ is crucial for the performance of Lasso Regression⁴. It's often selected using methods like cross-validation or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)⁵. However, it's important to note that a large tuning parameter can overshrink large coefficients, causing a large bias⁹. Therefore, it's essential to balance the trade-off between model fitting and model sparsity⁸."

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can be used for non-linear regression problems, but it requires some adaptations¹²³.\n",

    "1. **Linearization**: If you can linearize the model, then Lasso Regression can be applied for an approximate solution¹. This is because what is measured is the dependent variable and not any of its possible transforms¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-linear Objectives**: The name \"Lasso\" is also used for non-linear objectives¹. The regularizing term can be seen as an \"add-on\". However, it might be much harder to solve in general¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: You can create non-linear terms through transformation (e.g., $x_1^2$, $x_2^3$, etc.) and see if they stay in the model⁴.\n",

   "source": [
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features¹²⁵. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**: Lasso Regression uses regularization to keep all the features but reduces the magnitude of the coefficients of the model¹². This is a good solution when each predictor contributes to predict the dependent variable¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variable Selection**: Lasso Regression has a built-in variable selection mechanism that can handle some multicollinearity without sacrificing interpretability⁵. If the collinearity is too high, however, Lasso's variable selection performance will start to suffer⁵.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exclusion of Irrelevant Parameters**: When we increase the value of the regularization parameter (lambda), the most important parameters shrink a little bit and the less important parameters go close to zero¹. So, Lasso is able to exclude irrelevant parameters from the model¹.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that if there are highly correlated or collinear predictors, Lasso Regression will only select one of them⁵. Therefore, while Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity, it might not be the best choice if you want to keep all correlated variables in your model."
